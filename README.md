# üõí Retail ETL & Data Warehouse Project | By Sagar Choudhury

Welcome to my **Retail Data Warehouse & Analytics Project**! üöÄ  
This project is a hands-on demonstration of designing and building a modern data warehouse using SQL Server and industry best practices. It focuses on ingesting raw data, transforming it using ETL pipelines, modeling it into a star schema, and analyzing business trends.

> ‚ö° Built entirely from scratch as part of my learning journey and portfolio.

## üß± Architecture Overview

I implemented the **Medallion Architecture** to structure and optimize the data processing workflow:

### üîπ Bronze Layer
- Stores raw data from CSV files (ERP & CRM)
- No transformation done here ‚Äî just staging

### üî∏ Silver Layer
- Data is cleansed, transformed, and standardized
- Joins ERP and CRM data, applies business rules

### üü° Gold Layer
- Final analytical tables (Star Schema: Fact & Dimension)
- Used for business intelligence and reporting

üìå Diagrams and workflows are stored in the `docs/` folder  
üìä (Designed using **draw.io**)

## üì¶ Data Sources

I used two mock datasets for simulation:

- `ERP_Sales.csv`: Product and transaction-level data
- `CRM_Customers.csv`: Customer demographics and engagement

These are available in the `datasets/` folder.

## üéØ Project Objectives

This project aims to:

- Practice **SQL-based ETL** development
- Build and understand the **Medallion architecture**
- Develop a **Star Schema** optimized for reporting
- Write **analytical SQL queries** to extract insights
- Optionally visualize the data using **Power BI**
